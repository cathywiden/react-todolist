========================================

**This to-do list will motivate you to get things done.**

Your entries are sorted by the time since you added them. This means that the app always shows entries first that you've been postponing *for the longest time*. 

If you ever want to *catch up* with your newest additions -- which I hope you do -- you'll simply have to do the ones on the top of your list first. Hopefully, this will give you the incentive to get them out of the way so that you can get more productive in your everyday life.

You can override this default setting by flagging items as prio (see the stars to the left side?) and then clicking on the button that says "â˜… up!". This will allow you to see your personal prio items on the very top of your list.

You can toggle between completed and pending status by clicking on the emojis.
